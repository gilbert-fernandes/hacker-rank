/**
 *
 * Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their books to a page number.
 * Brie can either start turning pages from the front of the book or from the back of the book.
 * She always turns pages one at a time. When she opens the book, page is always on the right side :
 *
 *   +------+------+
 *   |      |      |
 *   |      |      |
 *   |      |    1 |
 *   +------+------+
 *
 * When she flips page 1, she sees pages 2 and 3.
 * Each page except the last page will always be printed on both sides.
 * The last page may only be printed on the front, given the length of the book.
 * If the book is n pages long, and she wants to turn to page p
 * what is the minimum number of pages she will turn?
 * She can start at the beginning or the end of the book.
 *
 * Given n and p, find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order to arrive at page p.
