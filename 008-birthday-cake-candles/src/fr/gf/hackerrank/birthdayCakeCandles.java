/**
 * You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year
 * of her total age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. Your task is to
 * find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.
 *
 * For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height 4, 4, 1, 3 she will be
 * able to blow out  2 candles successfully, since the tallest candles are of height 4 and there are 2 such candles.
 *
 * constraints :
 * 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * 1 <= ar[i] <= 10^5
