/**
 *
 * Two cats and a mouse are at various positions on a line. You will be given their starting positions.
 * Your task is to determine which cat will reach the mouse first, assuming the mouse doesn't move and
 * the cats travel at equal speed. If the cats arrive at the same time, the mouse will be allowed to move
 * and it will escape while they fight.
 *
 * You are given q queries in the form of x,y and z representing the respective positions for cats A and B,
 * and for mouse C. Complete the function catAndMouse to return the appropriate answer to each query,
 * which will be printed on a new line.
 *
 * If cat A catches the mouse first, print Cat A.
 * If cat B catches the mouse first, print Cat B.
 *
 * If both cats reach the mouse at the same time, print Mouse C as the two cats fight and mouse escapes.
 *
 * For example, cat A is at position x=2 and cat B is at y=5.
 * If mouse is at position z=4, it is 2 units from cat A and 1 unit from cat B.
 * Cat will catch the mouse.
